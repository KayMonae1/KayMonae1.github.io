        <h2>My Name is Kala Montgomery</h2>
        <p>I am Kala Montgomery and I am building this website for my MMA2 class. We are working on coding and how to build websites. I think that this class is very helpful in technology. We are learning a lot of things that in my opinion people dont really learn at other schools. </p>

                <p>In my English class this year we worked on something called a Definding Moment. A Definding Moment is something that had a big effect or impact on your life. I chose to do the death of my brother back in 2011. He was killed by the police . I chose to do this moment because this changed me life because I wouldnt be the person I am today if it wasnt for my brother.</p>
